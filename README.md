 postman 

1. Rest  it mean represenatational state Transfer  architecture style  its a set of programs set to be used to create web servies. I think its the "canvos" that painters(coders) the paint on (set up a bunch of code to talke to each other) 

HTTP Verbs are 

Post/create 

Get/read 

Put/ update/replace 

Patch/ Update/Modify 

Delete/ Delete/Destroy 

3. I think we use rest because like before is away for coders to use the web servers in away to build the website and its away for them to talk to the servers and work together. the APi are like a waiter. what ever Crud function you give the Api(waiter) it will return a response or with what it is doing.
